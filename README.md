Google_Glass_Mirro_Api_demo


It's a quick start demo of mirro api. I am still learning from Google Mirror API's Quickstart for Java (https://github.com/googleglass/mirror-quickstart-java)
I change some part of the project and get mine.

Change part : format; adding a "insert html format card"; allow user type image's url.


How to use:

```
mvn jetty run
```

or 

```
mvn war: war 
```
get the .war file.
